This project uses the MovieLens dataset to build a movie recommender using collaborative filtering with Spark's Alternating Least Squares implementation. It is organised in two parts. The first one is about getting and parsing movies and ratings data into Spark RDDs. The second is about building and using the recommender and persisting it for later use in our on-line recommender system.

This project has been made with the help of this [tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/jadianes/building-a-recommender-with-apache-spark-python-example-app-part1-du1083qbw).
